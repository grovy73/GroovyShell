# GroovyShell - GSH
Welcome to the GroovyShell repo. This shell is not meant to be used. It is a toy project of mine to better learn the C language and some more low level concepts
## Building from source
Clone the repository and run the make file
```bash
git clone https://github.com/grovy73/GroovyShell.git
cd GroovyShell
make
```
